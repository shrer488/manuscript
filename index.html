				<h2>Form Follows Fashion</h2>
				<p>
					Wolfgang Weingart participated in the revolt against the strict minimalist approach of his Swiss predecessors. While his work is considered within the Modernist idiom, his experimentation with form and structure rejected the “neutral envelope” approach of ostensibly objective form-making in favor of intuitive choice and personal expression. When visiting CalArts in 1991, Weingart commented with disdain that he was no longer in fashion, as though whatever had replaced him as current design-of-choice was merely a trend somehow not as worthy as the trend he once embodied. Did he mean that the visual expression of his ideas had lost its power to communicate as time had altered its context? Or were the ideas themselves no longer popular? Or was it just that designers had seen the style of his work for too long and now looked to something new, out of boredom alone? I asked Weingart if he could elaborate on what appears to be a preoccupation with formal fashion (style) within the graphic design profession. What is this affliction that makes graphic designers crave perpetual stylistic (r)evolution? Weingart evaded the question inhibiting inquiry into a realm that makes most designers uneasy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Weingart’s reaction is not uncommon. I, myself, am reluctant to scratch the surface of most graphic design for fear of what I won’t find underneath. In the world of so-called legitimate style, “trendy” is a death sentence. When stylistic change in graphic design is tied to the rapid turnover and imitative nature of fashion, we begin to suspect that our work is merely shallow trend-following and empty form-pushing.

					<strong>–Alvin Lustig, Nine Pioneers</strong>

					In the fall of 1991, Nancy Skolos and Tom Wedell presented their work to the students at CalArts with a reserve common throughout the profession: the design conglomerates of the 1980’s have diminished, out of necessity, to the small offices of the 1990’s. With refreshing honesty, Nancy Skolos presented a gorgeous brochure that she admitted had unfortunately led to a decrease in sales for the client. That it was presented to an audience of designers for its formal qualities says that Skolos Wedell considered it one of their better (looking) pieces, in spite of the fact that it did not “function” in a way that was meaningful for the client who had commissioned it. When asked what was the purpose of graphic design, if not to aid marketing, Nancy replied, “I don’t know... to make the world a better place?”

				<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
					<p>
						Can style and trend be used interchangeably? Style is something you embody and can be noticed in your designs. And styles can be trends sometimes. But, I feel each individual has their own style, how they express their work. In the article however I feel they are used quite the same.
					</p>
					<p>
						When the author talked about his work being out of style, I felt like a lot of creators/designers could relate to it. Not bound to just the creative field, as new technologies take over, the works that were once popular are no longer in trend. Although new trends are influenced by the past, similar to fashion, as it moves on, it is replaced by something new and flashy while still being unsure till when this new discovery will last.
					</p>
					<p>
						Trends come and go, and following and keeping up with each trend, I feel risks finding your own consistent style that defines you. With Wolfgang Weingart’s comment he mentioned about his style no longer being in trend and how not following the crowd can lead to being irrelevant. I feel there is a tug of war between finding your style and the fear of missing out on what is new. And one must be sure of what they have or be intentional about what they want to create so as to create their own style. Trends are fun, they let you experiment, and also teach you new things, but one must not rely on trends alone to get forward in their design career.
					</p>
					<p>
						But, then again originality is a lost art or was it never there to begin with. We are always inspired by something and bring our own experience into it. And some choose the latest trends as a source of inspiration while some choose the past trends (classic designs). Either way it shapes what they create, so does it really matter if they follow the trend or not?
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>“I make solutions that nobody wants to problems that don’t exist.”</em><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						The fear of being asked why certain design decisions were made, and not having an answer to that, and one's “personal preference” not being a sufficient answer can be difficult. Sometimes you don’t have answers and sometimes some people just get it and you don’t need to answer. Does this have something to do with the vision? And sometimes the intention is not to understand the answer but to replace it. This makes me wonder if the answer has a lot to do with the ability to communicate and convince rather than the answer itself? Then again one might define design as “problem solving” so one should have a reason for design choices, and they should solve a particular problem or achieve a certain functionality.
