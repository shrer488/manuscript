				<h2>Form Follows Fashion</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Weingart">Wolfgang Weingart</a> participated in the revolt against the strict minimalist approach of his Swiss predecessors. While his work is considered within the Modernist idiom, his experimentation with form and structure rejected the <em>“neutral envelope”</em> approach of ostensibly objective form-making in favor of intuitive choice and personal expression. When visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_the_Arts">CalArts</a>  in 1991, Weingart commented with disdain that he was no longer in fashion, as though whatever had replaced him as current design-of-choice was merely a trend somehow not as worthy as the trend he once embodied. Did he mean that the visual expression of his ideas had lost its power to communicate as time had altered its context? Or were the ideas themselves no longer popular? Or was it just that designers had seen the style of his work for too long and now looked to something new, out of boredom alone? I asked Weingart if he could elaborate on what appears to be a preoccupation with formal fashion (style) within the graphic design profession. What is this affliction that makes graphic designers crave perpetual stylistic (r)evolution? Weingart evaded the question inhibiting inquiry into a realm that makes most designers uneasy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Weingart’s reaction is not uncommon. <mark>I, myself, am reluctant to scratch the surface of most graphic design for fear of what I won’t find underneath.</mark> In the world of so-called <em>legitimate style</em>, “trendy” is a death sentence. When stylistic change in graphic design is tied to the rapid turnover and imitative nature of fashion, we begin to suspect that our work is merely shallow trend-following and empty form-pushing.

						In the fall of 1991, 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Skolos">Nancy Skolos</a>
						and <a href="https://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/tom-wedell">Tom Wedell</a> presented their work to the students at CalArts with a reserve common throughout the profession: the design conglomerates of the 1980’s have diminished, out of necessity, to the small offices of the 1990’s. With refreshing honesty, Nancy Skolos presented a gorgeous brochure that she admitted had unfortunately led to a decrease in sales for the client. That it was presented to an audience of designers for its formal qualities says that Skolos Wedell considered it one of their better (looking) pieces, in spite of the fact that it did not <em>“function”</em> in a way that was meaningful for the client who had commissioned it. When asked what was the purpose of graphic design, if not to aid marketing, Nancy replied, <span class="italic">“I don’t know... to make the world a better place?”</span>

				<h2>Thoughts</h2>
					<section>
						<p class="my_thoughts_first_paragraph">
							Can style and trend be used interchangeably? I don't think so. Style is something you embody. It's visible in your work and reflects how you express yourself as an individual. While styles can sometimes become trends, I believe each person has their own distinct style that defines their creative voice. However, in the article I read, these terms seemed to be used almost interchangeably, which got me thinking.
						</p>
						<p>
							When the author talked about his work being "<em>out of style</em>," I felt many creators and designers could relate, and not just in creative fields. As new technologies emerge, work that was once popular falls out of "<em>trend</em>." While new trends draw from the past (much like fashion), they eventually get replaced by something new and flashy, leaving us uncertain how long each discovery will last.
						</p>
						<p>
							Trends come and go. I feel that chasing every trend risks losing the consistent style that defines you. Wolfgang Weingart's comment struck me: he mentioned his style was "<em>no longer in trend</em>" and how "<span class="italic">not following the crowd can lead to being irrelevant</span>." There's a tug of war between finding your style and the fear of missing out on what's new. To develop your own style, you must be intentional about what you want to create. Trends are fun. They let you experiment and teach you new things, but relying on trends alone won't sustain a design career.
						</p>
						<p>
							But then again, is <mark>originality a lost art, or was it never there to begin with?</mark> We're always inspired by something and bring our own experiences into our work. Some choose the latest trends as inspiration; others look to the past and classic designs. Either way, these influences shape what we create. So does it really matter if we follow trends or not?
						</p>
						<p>
							The fear of being asked why you made certain design decisions, and not having an answer, is real. When "<em>personal preference</em>" isn't considered a sufficient reply, it can be difficult. Sometimes you don't have answers. Sometimes some people just get it, and you don't need a comeback. Does this have something to do with vision? Other times, the intention isn't to understand your reasons at all, but to replace them. This makes me wonder:

							</blockquote>
							</p>
						<p>
							Then again, if we define design as "<em>problem solving</em>," shouldn't we have reasons for our design choices? Shouldn't they solve a particular problem or achieve a certain functionality? No?
